# Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis 📈

Welcome to the **Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis** repository! This project is designed to help you understand and apply time series analysis techniques for forecasting future values based on historical data. Time series analysis is crucial in various domains, including finance, economics, weather forecasting, and inventory management.

## 📚 Overview

Time series analysis involves understanding patterns in data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. By recognizing trends, seasonal effects, and cyclical patterns, we can make accurate predictions about future data points. This repository covers the basics of time series analysis, popular forecasting methods, and practical implementations.
